            <p>This course is a continuation of problem solving and object-oriented programming. There will be more emphasis on larger programs built from modules. You will be introduced to abstract data structures: stacks, queues, graphs, and trees and their implementations and associated algorithms. We will discuss elementary numerical methods and the construction of a simple graphical user interface (GUI).</p>
            <p>In this class, you will learn about:</p>
            <dl>
                <dt>Software Development Fundamentals</dt>
                <dd>To be able to design and implement a Java program to model a real-world system, and subsequently analyze its behavior.</dd>
                <dt>Programming Languages</dt>
                <dd>To know and use basic Java programming constructs for object-oriented problem solving (e.g., classes, polymorphism, inheritance, interfaces). </dd>
                <dt>Algorithms and Complexity</dt>
                <dd>To appreciate the role of algorithms and data structures in problem solving and software design (e.g., objected-oriented design, lists, files, searching and sorting) </dd>
                <dt>Software Engineering</dt>
                <dd>To develop programming skills that can serve as a foundation for further study in computer science.</dd>
                <dt>Social Issues and Professional Practice</dt>
                <dd>Social implications of computing in a networked world and the impact of social media on individualism, collectivism and culture. </dd>
            </dl>
            <p>AU Core Quantitative Literacy II (Q2) Outcomes:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Translate real-world questions or intellectual inquiries into quantitative frameworks.</li>
                <li>Select and apply appropriate quantitative methods or reasoning.</li>
                <li>Draw appropriate insights from the application of a quantitative framework.</li>
                <li>Explain quantitative reasoning and insights using appropriate forms of representation so that others could replicate the findings.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><b>Academic integrity:</b> Unless explicitly stated otherwise, you are expected to do your assignments and work collaboratively with your assigned teammate(s), but not share code with other teams in the class. It is not appropriate to find existing code, modify it and submit it as your own work. Code submitted for projects may be compared to existing databases of example student work to verify authenticity. Exams and quizzes will be an independent effort. If in doubt, confer with your instructor.</p>
            <p>All students are expected to adhere to the <a href='https://www.american.edu/academics/integrity/code.cfm'>American University Honor Code. </a> </p>

            <h3> Class Participation </h3>
            <p>It is expected that students will come to class, be prepared by doing the readings, and will pay attention and participate in discussions. Participation is scored by evaluation of in-class activities and your responses to in-class quizzes.<!-- Participation will be scored both by instructor review of the quality of work during in-class exercises and peer-assessment of your contributions to the group. --></p>
            <p>Any questions regarding general rules and regulations should first be directed to the American University <a target="_blank" href="https://www.american.edu/provost/registrar/university_catalog.cfm">Catalog</a>. If you still have questions, please seek out the TA or Instructor during the posted office hours.</p>
            <h4>Use of Computers and Cell Phones in Class</h4>
            <p><a href="http://pss.sagepub.com/content/early/2014/04/22/0956797614524581.abstract">Educational research</a> shows that taking notes by hand on paper will lead to better retention of material than taking notes by typing. Also, in the past classrooms have had issues with students not only not paying attention but also disrupting others during class-- by playing games, by accidentally clicking on a video with the sound on, etc.</p>
            <p>If you have a laptop, you should bring it to class. Do not use it for in-class assignments unless you are directly advised to do so by the instructor. Throughout the semester we will frequently pause lecture to work together to solve programming challenges in groups.</p>
            <p>Please do not use your cell phone in class.</p>
            <h3>Homework Projects</h3>
            <p>Homeworks will be graded on a rubric of criteria (specified on the assignment) such as accuracy of code input/output, completeness, runtime errors, comments, etc. For each criterion, you will receive either a check plus, check, or check minus. Most criterion will receive a check. A plus means "you impressed me." A minus means the assignment is incomplete, incorrect, or sloppy in some fashion with respect to that criterion. Pluses and minuses are combined to give your grade for the assignment. For most assignments, you start out half way between a B+ and A-. One plus makes it an A-; one minus makes it a B+. A project receiving minuses for all criteria will receive about 75% of credit, and a project that receives an X for all criteria will receive about 50% of credit or less. These are general guidelines to let you know what to expect. Grading on specific assignments may differ.</p>
            <p>Project submissions that fail to compile will not be accepted under any circumstances.</p>
            <p>All assignments will be submitted through the class Github system, which will be introduced in early lectures. Students are encouraged, but not required, to work in pairs (no groups larger than two people). Only Project 0 must be completed individually. For other projects, the class Github will be set up to accommodate teamwork. Note, however, that students working together must equally contribute to the project. Project submissions will be reviewed to ensure balanced contribution for paired submissions - grades will be scaled accordingly in situations where one student did all the work.</p>
            <p>Even though we encourage collaboration with a partner, sharing code between groups is strictly forbidden - this is a form of plagiarism. If you directly copy and paste code from the Internet or the text, cite your source in your comments (but also ensure that you understand what the code is doing - not all code on the web is good!). </p>
            <h4>Late Submission</h4>
            <p>Assignments are due at 8pm on the specified date unless stated otherwise. There is a grace period until midnight. Assignments turned in after midnight will be penalized with a letter grade (10%) for each 24 hour period after the initial 8pm deadline. Submissions that do not compile will not be accepted. Projects are much larger than the homeworks assigned in the previous course, and students are given multiple weeks to complete them. Waiting until the last minute is a recipe for disaster - if you are stuck early, come to office hours for the instructor or TA ASAP to get unstuck!</p>
            <p>Throughout the semester you have two "grace" days that can be used to mitigate the penalty of a late assignment submission. These are applied automatically.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-6">
            <h3>Attendance</h3>
            <p>Students are required to attend all lectures. If you need to miss class for any reason, you are allowed two excused absences - no questions asked. Prolonged absences must be discussed with the instructor and are not guaranteed to be excused.</p>
            <p>Students who arrive after the start of class will receive half credit for attendance on that day. Students who arrive after 30 minutes will be counted absent.</p>
            <h3>Exams</h3>
            <p>Exams cover the material from the lectures, projects, and reading. While not necessarily cumulative, each exam will require understanding many of the concepts covered in the preceding exams. Exams consist of multiple choice, short answer, and long answer questions. Each exam, except the final, is weighted equally.</p>
            <p>The final exam is cumulative, and is worth 20% of your total grade for the course. Half of the final exam will be material covered for prior exams, half will be material that is new since the previous exam.</p>
            <!-- <p><span class="label label-danger">Notice</span> In addition to the total overall class percentage for determining your grade, you must have a passing average (>60 average) on the 3 exams and the final exam all combined together, not each one individually, in order to pass the course. We implement this policy as a check-and-balance with respect to the HWs and our allowance of collaboration on them. Note that this does not mean that you have the option of only using the four exams to determine your grade. All the categories above will be used in the grade calculation, but in addition, you must have a passing grade on just the four exams in order to pass the course.</p>
            <p>Exams are typically curved based on class performance. </p> -->
            <p>After you are handed back your graded exam, you will have an opportunity to return it with corrections for partial credit on missed questions.</p>
            <!-- <h3>Quizzes</h3>
            <p>A short five-minute quiz is administered at the beginning of each lecture. Each quiz consists of two questions from the previous lecture or reading. You have the option of answering either question to receive full credit.</p>
            <p>Students begin the semester with a 100 quiz score. For each daily quiz in which they are not able to answer either question, this score will be reduced by -3. On any day that a student successfully answers both of the quiz questions, the score will be increased by 3 points. If you have a 100 already, and can successfully answer both questions, you can effectively "bank" the +3 for a later day in which you are unable to complete the quiz.</p> -->

            <h3>Students with Disabilities</h3>
            <p>If you wish to receive accommodations for a disability, please notify me with a letter from the Academic Support and Access Center. As accommodations are not retroactive, timely notification at the beginning of the semester, if possible, is strongly recommended. To register with a disability or for questions about disability accommodations, contact the Academic Support and Access Center at 202-885-3360 or asac@american.edu, or drop by the ASAC in MGC 243.</p>
            <h3>Academic Support</h3>
            <p>All students may take advantage of the Academic Support and Access Center (ASAC) for individual academic skills counseling, workshops, Tutoring, peer tutor referrals, and Supplemental Instruction. The ASAC is located in Mary Graydon Center 243.  Additional academic support resources available at AU include the Bender Library, the Writing Center (located in the Library), the Math Lab (located in Don Meyers Technology and Innovation Building), and the Center for Language Exploration, Acquisition, & Research (CLEAR) in Anderson Hall. A more complete list of campus-wide resources is available in the ASAC.</p>
            <h3>Tutoring</h3>
            <p>The Quantitative Academic Support program provides drop-in and one-on-one tutoring for CSC 121, 280, and 281. Tutors help students learn course concepts, develop study strategies, complete assignments, and study for exams. Tutors may not be able to help with all problems; students must consult with the course instructor for additional assistance.</p>
            <p> Drop-in assistance is available in DMTI 207 (hours TBD). One-on-one appointments can be scheduled at american.mywconline.net (choose Quant Support). Tutoring begins the third week of classes and ends the last day of classes. Email <a href="mailto:quantsupport@american.edu">quantsupport@american.edu</a> with questions.
